# Introduction to C++ Programming Language

**C++** is a powerful, high-performance programming language that builds upon the foundation of C. It is widely used for system/software development, game development, and performance-critical applications. C++ combines the efficiency of low-level programming with the flexibility of high-level abstractions, making it a versatile choice for developers.

## Key Features of C++
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Supports classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
- **High Performance**: Offers fine-grained control over system resources and memory.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Provides a rich set of reusable templates for data structures and algorithms.
- **Cross-Platform**: Write once, compile anywhere with platform-specific optimizations.
- **Extensibility**: Allows integration with other languages and libraries.

## Common Use Cases

- **System Programming**: Operating systems, drivers, and embedded systems.
- **Game Development**: Popular in game engines like Unreal Engine.
- **High-Performance Applications**: Financial systems, simulations, and real-time systems.
- **Desktop Applications**: GUI-based software and tools.

C++ has a steep learning curve but offers unmatched control and performance, making it a favorite among experienced developers. Whether you're building a simple application or a complex system, C++ provides the tools and flexibility to bring your ideas to life.


## Header file

`Header files` in C++ are special `files with a .h or .hpp extension` that contain declarations of:

- Classes
- Functions
- Variables
- Templates
- Constants
- Macros
- Type definitions


Header Files provide a way to separate declarations from implementations, promoting code organization and reusability. Most header files contain `preprocessor directives like #ifndef, #define, and #endif (or #pragma once)` to prevent multiple inclusions of the same file.

### Use header files in source files

Header files are included in `source files` using the `#include` directive, for example:

- to inculde system headers: `#include <iostream>` (with angle brackets)
- to include User-defined headers: `#include "myheader.h"` (with quotes)



### Advantage of using Header Files?

Header files allow us to separate interface (what functions do) from implementation (how they do it). 

If the implementation changes, other source code which uses the header file don't require recompiling every file that uses the interface.
