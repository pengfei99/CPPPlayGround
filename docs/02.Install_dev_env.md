# Install dev env for C++

In this section, we will show how to setup a dev env for C++:
- ubuntu/debian
- windows


## 1. For Linux (ubuntu)

To start developing in C++ on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Install a C++ Compiler
Ubuntu comes with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which includes `g++` for C++ development. Install it using:

```bash
# check if the c++ compile exist or not
g++ --version

# expected output
g++ (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0

# if not exists, run the below command for installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++

# then check the installed version
g++ --version
```

### 1.2 Install a Code Editor or IDE

You can choose one of the below IDE:
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code (Recommand)
- CLion
- Etc.

### 1.3 Set Up Build Tools

Install `make` for building projects:
```bash
sudo apt install make
```

### 1.4 Debugging Tools
Install `gdb` for debugging:
```bash
sudo apt install gdb
```

### 1.5 Optional: Install CMake
CMake is a popular build system for managing complex projects:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```

### 1.6 Test Your dev env

Create a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
        cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
        return 0;
}
```

Save it as `hello.cpp`, then compile and run:

```bash
# you should see a binary file hello after this command
g++ hello.cpp -o hello

# to run the executable
./hello

# 
```

You are now ready to start developing in C++ on Ubuntu!
