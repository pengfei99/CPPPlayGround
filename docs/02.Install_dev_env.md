# Install dev env for C++

In this section, we will show how to setup a dev env for C++:
- ubuntu/debian
- windows


## 1. For Linux (ubuntu)

To start developing in C++ on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Install a C++ Compiler
Ubuntu comes with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which includes `g++` for C++ development. Install it using:

```bash
# check if the c++ compile exist or not
g++ --version

# expected output
g++ (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0

# if not exists, run the below command for installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++

# then check the installed version
g++ --version
```

### 1.2 Install a Code Editor or IDE

You can choose one of the below IDE:
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code (Recommand)
- CLion
- Etc.

### 1.3 Set Up Build Tools

Install `make` for building projects:
```bash
sudo apt install make
```

### 1.4 Debugging Tools
Install `gdb` for debugging:
```bash
sudo apt install gdb
```

### 1.5 Optional: Install CMake
CMake is a popular build system for managing complex projects:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```


## 2. For Windows

The are many ways to setup C/C++ dev env in windows, such as:

- MSYS2(https://www.msys2.org/)
- Visual Studio (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170)

In this tutorial, we only show how to install with **MSYS2**. The official installation doc can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

### 2.1 Install MSYS2

You can get the `installer(.exe)` from this [page](https://www.msys2.org/#installation). Run the installer, choose the `target installation path`(important information, we will need it after). 

After the installation, check the `Run MSYS2` box, you should see a `MSYS2 Prompt`. In this prompt, you can use a package manager called `pacman`.

We will use it to install MinGW-w64 tool suites(everything you need to build C++ dev env). 

```shell
# install the MinGW-w64 tool suites
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain

# you need to choose all composants

# after the installation, you can check the installed tools
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version

```

### 2.2 Add MSYS2 to your path

You can notice, the command `g++` works in `MSYS2 Prompt`, but not in `CMD` or `Powershell`. So to make it available every where, you need to add the location of `MSYS2` in your PATH.

For example, the installation path for my `MSYS2` is `C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\msys64`. I need to add `C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\msys64\ucrt64\bin` in PATH.

After this, open a new  `CMD` or `Powershell` and try the below command

```shell
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version

```

### 2.3 Configure your ide

I recommend you to use `VS code`, you can follow this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) to configure your vscode. 


## 3. Test Your dev env

Create a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
        cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
        return 0;
}
```

Save it as `hello.cpp`, then compile and run:

```bash
# you should see a binary file hello after this command
g++ hello.cpp -o hello

# to run the executable
./hello

# 
```

You are now ready to start developing in C++ !


## 4. Static code analysis

In vscode, there is a plugin for doing the static code analysis. You can check this page for more details: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbenden.c-cpp-flylint

This plugin requires backend analyser, cppcheck is one of them, you can check this page for more details: https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/
