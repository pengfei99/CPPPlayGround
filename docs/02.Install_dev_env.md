# Install dev env for C++

In this section, we will show how to setup a dev env for C++:
- ubuntu/debian
- windows


## 1. For Linux (ubuntu)

To start developing in C++ on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

### 1.1 Install a C++ Compiler
Ubuntu comes with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), which includes `g++` for C++ development. Install it using:

```bash
# check if the c++ compile exist or not
g++ --version

# expected output
g++ (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0
Copyright (C) 2023 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

# if not exists, run the below command for installation
sudo apt update
sudo apt install g++

# then check the installed version
g++ --version
```

### 1.2 Install a Code Editor or IDE

You can choose one of the below IDE:
- Visual Studio
- Visual Studio Code (Recommand)
- CLion
- Etc.

### 1.3 Set Up Build Tools

Install `make` for building projects:
```bash
sudo apt install make
```

### 1.4 Debugging Tools
Install `gdb` for debugging:
```bash
sudo apt install gdb
```

### 1.5 Optional: Install CMake
CMake is a popular build system for managing complex projects:
```bash
sudo apt install cmake
```


## 2. For Windows

The are many ways to setup C/C++ dev env in windows, such as:

- MSYS2(https://www.msys2.org/)
- Visual Studio (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/?view=msvc-170)

In this tutorial, we only show how to install with **MSYS2**. The official installation doc can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw)

### 2.1 Install MSYS2

You can get the `installer(.exe)` from this [page](https://www.msys2.org/#installation). Run the installer, choose the `target installation path`(important information, we will need it after). 

After the installation, check the `Run MSYS2` box, you should see a `MSYS2 Prompt`. In this prompt, you can use a package manager called `pacman`.

```shell
pacman --version
```

### 2.2 MSYS2 different shells

After running the `msys2 installer`, you will notice, there are `four different shell prompts` can be launched. 
|Shell	|Target Platform	|Compiler Triplet	|Use Case|
|-------|---------------------|-----------------------|----------|
|MSYS2 shell	|MSYS2 (POSIX layer)	|i686-pc-msys	|Only for running build tools (e.g., bash, git, make), not for building Windows apps|
|mingw64 shell	|Native Windows (64-bit)	|x86_64-w64-mingw32	|✅ Best for 64-bit C++/Windows development (e.g., wxWidgets, Qt)|
|ucrt64 shell	|Native Windows (64-bit, UCRT)	|x86_64-w64-mingw32 + UCRT	|For building apps against Microsoft's Universal C Runtime (UCRT)|
|clang64 shell	|Native Windows (64-bit, Clang)	|x86_64-w64-windows-gnu	|For using Clang instead of GCC|

> **Each shell has its own package environment**. For example, mingw64 shell are located in `/path/to/msys2/mingw64/`,
> ucrt64 shell are located in `/path/to/msys2/ucrt64/`
> If you install `cmake from the ucrt64 shell`, it will **NOT** be available in the `mingw64 shell`, and vice versa.
>

#### 2.2.1 MSYS2 Shell
It emulates a `Unix-like environment (like Cygwin)`.
It uses MSYS2-specific POSIX toolchain (/usr/bin/gcc → not suitable for Windows binaries).
It can not be used for compiling native Windows apps.
We can only call build tools like `make, cmake, autoconf`.

#### 2.2.2 mingw64 Shell

It Uses GCC targeting native Windows (64-bit).
It uses the compiler triplet: x86_64-w64-mingw32
It can be used to compile real Windows apps and libraries (e.g., .exe, .dll) with `no POSIX dependency`.
It's one of the `best choice for GUI development` (wxWidgets, Qt, SDL, etc.).

#### 2.2.3 ucrt64 Shell

It uses same `GCC-based toolchain as mingw64`, but links against **Microsoft's UCRT** instead of **MSVCRT**.

UCRT = newer, modern runtime used by Visual Studio.

Ideal for better compatibility with other UCRT-linked libraries or apps.

#### 2.2.4. clang64 Shell

It uses LLVM/Clang instead of GCC.

Can target the same Windows APIs.

Useful if you prefer Clang, or want Clang sanitizers, modern C++ support, etc.


#### 2.3 mingw64 shell vs ucrt64 shell

Based on the above information, we only recommend two environments for building C++ apps in windows.
- **mingw64**: This shell runs on MSVCRT(Microsoft Visual C Runtime)
- **UCRT**: This shell runs on UCRT(Universal C Runtime)

|Feature	|MSVCRT|	UCRT|
|---------------|-------|-----------|
|Status	|Legacy (older)	|✅ Modern and officially supported by Microsoft|
|Introduced	|Long ago (Visual Studio 6 era)	|With Visual Studio 2015|
|Runtime Location|Built into Windows (often preinstalled)|Installed via Visual C++ Redistributable|
|Compatibility	|Broad, works with older systems|Better C++11+ conformance, modern APIs|
|Thread Safety & Standards|Older libc behavior, less consistent	|Better standards compliance, improved behavior|
|Future-proofing |❌ Legacy|✅ Preferred by Microsoft going forward|


#### 2.4 Install all dependencies in UCRT shell environment

In this tutorial, we will use **UCRT** as our default shell environment

```shell
# install the MinGW-w64 tool suites
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain

# you need to choose all composants

# after the installation, you can check the installed tools
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version

```

### 2.5 Add UCRT shell environment to your path

You can notice, the command `g++` works in `UCRT Prompt`, but not in `CMD` or `Powershell`. So to make it available every where, you need to add the location of `UCRT` in your PATH.

For example, the installation path for my `UCRT` is `C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\msys64`. I need to add `C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\msys64\ucrt64\bin` in PATH.

After this, open a new  `CMD` or `Powershell` and try the below command

```shell
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version

```



### 2.6 Configure your ide

I recommend you to use `VS code`, you can follow this [tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) to configure your vscode. 

As we use **UCRT** as our default shell environment. In `VS code`, we need to choose **UCRT** as default compiler, etc.

## 3. Test Your dev env

Create a simple C++ program:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
        cout << "Hello, C++!" << endl;
        return 0;
}
```

Save it as `hello.cpp`, then compile and run:

```bash
# you should see a binary file hello after this command
g++ hello.cpp -o hello

# to run the executable
./hello

# 
```

You are now ready to start developing in C++ !

> You can find a working example in folder [SimpleProj](../src/course/00_env_setup/SimpleProj)


## 4. Use CMake to build your project

In `section-3`, we use g++ to build the executable. For a complex project, which uses third party packages and extra resources such as images, data, etc. It's just impossible to build with g++. So we need to use a build tool.
The most popular build tool for C++ project is called CMake.

### 4.1 Install CMake on linux

The package manager of Ubuntu comes with a CMake. You can install it with 

```shell
sudo apt install cmake
```

### 4.2 Install CMake on Windows via tarball

You can download the cmake https://cmake.org/download/ (source or binary) based on your requirements. I used the \
complied binary windows_x64 zip file.

```shell
# download and unzip the CMake bin in a folder. For example
C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\CMake\cmake-4.0.2-windows-x86_64

# create a CMAKE_HOME in your env var
# then add it to your path with %CMAKE_HOME%\bin

# now check your install with CMD or Powershell
cmake --version

# expected output
cmake version 4.0.2
CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).

# get all possible options
cmake --help
```

### 4.3 Install CMake on Windows via MSYS2

As MSYS2 comes with multiple shell environments, You need to choose one environment first. We recommend **UCRT**.

Open an UCRT shell prompt

```shell
# check if you have cmake 
cmake --version

# if not, install it
```



## 5. Static code analysis

In vscode, there is a plugin for doing the static code analysis. You can check this page for more details: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jbenden.c-cpp-flylint

This plugin requires backend analyser, cppcheck is one of them, you can check this page for more details: https://cppcheck.sourceforge.io/
