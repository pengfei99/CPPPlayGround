# Import CPP libraries

The best way to import `C++ libraries` like wxWidgets on both Windows and Linux is to use a 
`cross-platform build system(e.g. CMake)` that can handle dependency discovery and configuration cleanly.

We recommend `CMake + Find Modules`. Because with CMake:
- Works seamlessly across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Automatically finds include paths, link libraries, and flags.
- Supports system-installed or custom-built libraries.
- Widely used in professional projects.

The easy way is to download the already build binary.
But the version of your `local GCC version must match exactly the wxWidgets binary GCC version`. 

```shell
# get your local gcc version
g++ --version

# example output
g++ (x86_64-posix-seh, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 13.2.0
```

In the above output example, we get information such as:
- GCC version: 13.2.0 
- Target: x86_64 (64-bit)
- Thread model: posix 
- Exception model: seh (Structured Exception Handling)

In this tutorial, we will try to import a C++ libraries(framework) called `wxWidgets`. You can find more details about 
this framework [here](https://wxwidgets.org/) 

## 1. Build the binary yourself

To do this, you need to have:
- CMake:
- Make(mingw32-make for windows):

### 1.1 Get the source of wxWidgets

Get the source files of `wxWidgets` from their [github page]( https://github.com/wxWidgets).

> If you downloaded the `.zip file` from GitHub, you will have errors when you build. It's because the archive 
> does NOT contain submodules(dependent packages) for compilation. It means the 3rdparty/ directory in 
> the `.zip` file is incomplete.

To get all dependent packages, run the below command

```shell
# clone the source file with dependent packages
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets.git
# This downloads everything inside 3rdparty/, including: PCRE2, expat, zlib, libpng, jpeg

# build the binary
cd C:\path\to\wxWidgets\build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=0 UNICODE=1
```


### 1.2 Build Under windows

To do this 



## 2. Get the already built binary from wxWidgets github page

In the github page of wxWidgets, you can notice, there are already built binary for different OS and C++ compiler.
You only need to find the correct match.

For example, if I have a prebuilt wxWidgets with name `wxMSW-3.2.4_gcc-13.2.0_msw64_SEH_ReleaseDLL.7z`.
It means this wxWidgets prebuilt: 
- Built with GCC 13.2.0
- For 64-bit Windows
- SEH exception handling
- Release DLL build

> You need to match this with your environment

## 3. Use UCRT shell of MSYS2

You can also use the package manager of the `UCRT` shell environment. This solution is recommended, because it check 
the compatibility automatically, so you don't need to verify that yourself.

```shell
# this will install 
pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-wxwidgets3.2-msw
```

You don't need mingw32-make

## 3. 
## 4. An example

We'll create a simple GUI app using wxWidgets with:

- main.cpp (your C++ code)
- CMakeLists.txt (the build configuration)
- make (automatically run via cmake --build)

Project Structure

```shell
MyWxApp/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── main.cpp
```

Below is an example of `main.cpp`

```cpp
// This application creates a window with a label that says "Hello, World!" and a button labeled "Click Me"
// When you click the button, the label changes to "Button Clicked!"

#include <wx/wx.h>
// use the wxWidgets header file that contains declarations for wxWidgets classes and functions
// wxWidgets is a C++ library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

// Main application class definition that initializes the program
class MyApp : public wxApp
{
public:
    virtual bool OnInit();
};

// Main window class that contains the GUI elements
class MyFrame : public wxFrame
{
    // The constructor takes a title as parameter and sets up the window
public:
    MyFrame(const wxString &title);

    // This method is the event handler that's called when the button is clicked
private:
    void OnButtonClick(wxCommandEvent &event);

    wxStaticText *label;
    wxButton *button;
};

// wxWidgets macro that sets up the application entry point
wxIMPLEMENT_APP(MyApp);

// Define the OnInit method, which is called when the application MyApp starts
// This method belongs to the MyApp class
bool MyApp::OnInit()
{
    // Create a new instance of MyFrame, which is the main window of the application
    // The title of the window is set to "wxWidgets Simple App"
    MyFrame *frame = new MyFrame("wxWidgets Simple App");
    frame->Show(true);
    return true;
}

// Define the constructor for MyFrame, which sets up the GUI elements
// This constructor belongs to the MyFrame class
MyFrame::MyFrame(const wxString &title)
    : wxFrame(NULL, wxID_ANY, title, wxDefaultPosition, wxSize(300, 200))
{

    wxPanel *panel = new wxPanel(this, wxID_ANY);
    // Create a panel to hold the GUI elements
    // Create a static text label with the text "Hello, World!" at position (100, 30) on the panel
    label = new wxStaticText(panel, wxID_ANY, "Hello, World!", wxPoint(100, 30));

    // Create a button with the label "Click Me" at position (100, 70) on the panel
    // The button is created with a unique ID (wxID_ANY) and is associated with the panel
    button = new wxButton(panel, wxID_ANY, "Click Me", wxPoint(100, 70));

    // Bind the button click event to the OnButtonClick method
    // This means that when the button is clicked, the OnButtonClick method will be called
    button->Bind(wxEVT_BUTTON, &MyFrame::OnButtonClick, this);
}

// Define the OnButtonClick method, which is called when the button is clicked
void MyFrame::OnButtonClick(wxCommandEvent &event)
{
    // Change the label text to "Button Clicked!" when the button is clicked
    // This method belongs to the MyFrame class
    label->SetLabel("Button Clicked!");
}
```

> The content of `CMakeLists.txt` is different based on the OS. 

### 4.1 Under linux

For linux, the `CMakeLists.txt` is quite simple

```txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyWxApp)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED COMPONENTS core base)

include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})

add_executable(MyWxApp main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MyWxApp ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

```

```shell
# install Dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libwxgtk3.2-dev build-essential

# create build directory
mkdir -p MyWxApp/build
cd MyWxApp/build

# Run CMake to Generate Makefiles
cmake ..

# Build the app with Make
make

# Run the App
./MyWxApp
```

### 4.2 Under windows



In this example, we will use CMake to import a CPP library(framework) `wxWidgets`. You can get the source file from
this [page](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases). 

> As we want to build the library, so download the source file, not the binary.
> 

```shell
# download and unzip the source file in a folder. For example
C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\CPP_libs\wxWidgets-3.2.8

# compile and build it with mingw32-make(make for windows)
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=0 UNICODE=1

# create a build folder
mkdir build && cd build

# tell cmake to use MinGW generator
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..

# call make to build the executable
mingw32-make
```
