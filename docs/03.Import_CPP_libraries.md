# Import CPP libraries

The best way to import `C++ libraries` like wxWidgets on both Windows and Linux is to use a 
`cross-platform build system(e.g. CMake)` that can handle dependency discovery and configuration cleanly.

We recommend `CMake + Find Modules`. Because with CMake:
- Works seamlessly across Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Automatically finds include paths, link libraries, and flags.
- Supports system-installed or custom-built libraries.
- Widely used in professional projects.

The esaiest way is to download the already build binary. But the version of your `local GCC version must match exactly the wxWidgets binary GCC version`. 

```shell
# get your local gcc version
```

## 1. Install CMake

You can download it from the official [cmake web site](https://cmake.org/download/). Or use the system built-in CMake.

### 1.1 Under linux

The package manager of Ubuntu comes with a CMake. You can easily install it with 

```shell
sudo apt install cmake
```



### 1.2 Under windows

You can download the cmake https://cmake.org/download/ (source or binary) based on your requirements. I used the \
complied binary windows_x64 zip file.

```shell
# download and unzip the CMake bin in a folder. For example
C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\CMake\cmake-4.0.2-windows-x86_64

# create a CMAKE_HOME in your env var
# then add it to your path with %CMAKE_HOME%\bin

# now check your install with CMD or Powershell
cmake --version

# expected output
cmake version 4.0.2
CMake suite maintained and supported by Kitware (kitware.com/cmake).

# get all possible options
cmake --help
```

## 2. Use CMake to  and mingw32-make

You don't need mingw32-make

## 3. 
## 4. An example

We'll create a simple GUI app using wxWidgets with:

- main.cpp (your C++ code)
- CMakeLists.txt (the build configuration)
- make (automatically run via cmake --build)

Project Structure

```shell
MyWxApp/
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── main.cpp
```

Below is an example of `main.cpp`

```cpp
// This application creates a window with a label that says "Hello, World!" and a button labeled "Click Me"
// When you click the button, the label changes to "Button Clicked!"

#include <wx/wx.h>
// use the wxWidgets header file that contains declarations for wxWidgets classes and functions
// wxWidgets is a C++ library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

// Main application class definition that initializes the program
class MyApp : public wxApp
{
public:
    virtual bool OnInit();
};

// Main window class that contains the GUI elements
class MyFrame : public wxFrame
{
    // The constructor takes a title as parameter and sets up the window
public:
    MyFrame(const wxString &title);

    // This method is the event handler that's called when the button is clicked
private:
    void OnButtonClick(wxCommandEvent &event);

    wxStaticText *label;
    wxButton *button;
};

// wxWidgets macro that sets up the application entry point
wxIMPLEMENT_APP(MyApp);

// Define the OnInit method, which is called when the application MyApp starts
// This method belongs to the MyApp class
bool MyApp::OnInit()
{
    // Create a new instance of MyFrame, which is the main window of the application
    // The title of the window is set to "wxWidgets Simple App"
    MyFrame *frame = new MyFrame("wxWidgets Simple App");
    frame->Show(true);
    return true;
}

// Define the constructor for MyFrame, which sets up the GUI elements
// This constructor belongs to the MyFrame class
MyFrame::MyFrame(const wxString &title)
    : wxFrame(NULL, wxID_ANY, title, wxDefaultPosition, wxSize(300, 200))
{

    wxPanel *panel = new wxPanel(this, wxID_ANY);
    // Create a panel to hold the GUI elements
    // Create a static text label with the text "Hello, World!" at position (100, 30) on the panel
    label = new wxStaticText(panel, wxID_ANY, "Hello, World!", wxPoint(100, 30));

    // Create a button with the label "Click Me" at position (100, 70) on the panel
    // The button is created with a unique ID (wxID_ANY) and is associated with the panel
    button = new wxButton(panel, wxID_ANY, "Click Me", wxPoint(100, 70));

    // Bind the button click event to the OnButtonClick method
    // This means that when the button is clicked, the OnButtonClick method will be called
    button->Bind(wxEVT_BUTTON, &MyFrame::OnButtonClick, this);
}

// Define the OnButtonClick method, which is called when the button is clicked
void MyFrame::OnButtonClick(wxCommandEvent &event)
{
    // Change the label text to "Button Clicked!" when the button is clicked
    // This method belongs to the MyFrame class
    label->SetLabel("Button Clicked!");
}
```

> The content of `CMakeLists.txt` is different based on the OS. 

### 4.1 Under linux

For linux, the `CMakeLists.txt` is quite simple

```txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
project(MyWxApp)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED COMPONENTS core base)

include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})

add_executable(MyWxApp main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(MyWxApp ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

```

```shell
# install Dependencies
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cmake g++ libwxgtk3.2-dev build-essential

# create build directory
mkdir -p MyWxApp/build
cd MyWxApp/build

# Run CMake to Generate Makefiles
cmake ..

# Build the app with Make
make

# Run the App
./MyWxApp
```

### 4.2 Under windows



In this example, we will use CMake to import a CPP library(framework) `wxWidgets`. You can get the source file from
this [page](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases). 

> As we want to build the library, so download the source file, not the binary.
> 

```shell
# download and unzip the source file in a folder. For example
C:\Users\PLIU\Documents\Tool\CPP_libs\wxWidgets-3.2.8

# compile and build it with mingw32-make(make for windows)
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc BUILD=release SHARED=0 UNICODE=1

# create a build folder
mkdir build && cd build

# tell cmake to use MinGW generator
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ..

# call make to build the executable
mingw32-make
```
