# Object oriented programming in C++


## 1. Class

In C++, a **class** is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (data members) and behaviors (member functions) that the objects of the class will have. 

### 1.2 Syntax of a Class Definition

Below is a general form of Class Definition in C++

```cpp
class ClassName {
public: 
    // Public members (accessible from outside the class)
    DataType property1;
    void method1();

private:
    // Private members (accessible only within the class)
    DataType property2;
    void method2();

protected:
    // Protected members (accessible within the class and derived classes)
    DataType property3;

    // Constructor (optional)
    ClassName();

    // Destructor (optional)
    ~ClassName();
};
```

You can notice the key Components of a Class

1. **Access Specifiers**:
   - `public`: Members declared under this are accessible from outside the class.
   - `private`: Members declared under this are accessible only within the class.
   - `protected`: Members declared under this are accessible within the class and its derived classes.

2. **Data Members**:
   - These are variables that hold the data or state of the class.

3. **Member Functions**:
   - These are functions that define the behavior of the class. They can access and modify the class's data members.

4. **Constructors**:
   - Special functions used to initialize objects of the class. They have the same name as the class and no return type.

5. **Destructors**:
   - Special functions used to clean up when an object is destroyed. They have the same name as the class prefixed with a `~` and no return type.

### 1.3 An example

Hereâ€™s a simple example of a class definition in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    // Data members
    string brand;
    int speed;

    // Constructor
    Car(string b, int s) {
        brand = b;
        speed = s;
    }

    // Member function
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Create an object of the class
    Car myCar("Toyota", 120);

    // Access member function
    myCar.displayInfo();

    return 0;
}
```

Let's check the sample code 

1. **Class Definition**:
   - The `Car` class has two public data members (`brand` and `speed`) and one public member function (`displayInfo`).

2. **Constructor**:
   - The constructor initializes the `brand` and `speed` when an object is created.

3. **Object Creation**:
   - The `myCar` object is created using the `Car` constructor.

4. **Accessing Members**:
   - The `displayInfo` function is called using the `myCar` object to print the car's details.
  
### 1.4 Define method outside the class

In the above example, you can notice, we have defined the method `displayInfo` inside the class definition. 
In a small example like this, defining methods inside the class is often more convenient. 


However, in larger projects, separating declarations from implementations (using the :: syntax) is considered better practice because:
1. It keeps class definitions clean and concise
2. Typically, class declarations go in header files while implementations go in source files
3. It improves compilation times for large projects

For example, I want to add a new method called `getEngineModel` to return the car engine model. I will use `scope resolution operator (::)` to define 
the `implementation of the method` outside the class. Inside class, I only have the method declaration without any logic. 

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Car {
public:
    // Data members
    string brand;
    int speed;
    string engineModel;
    
    // Constructor
    Car(string b, int s, string e) {
        brand = b;
        speed = s;
        engineModel = e;
    }
    
    // Member function
    void displayInfo() {
        cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Speed: " << speed << " km/h" << endl;
    }
    
    // Method declaration only (not implementation)
    string getEngineModel();
};

// Method implementation outside the class
string Car::getEngineModel() {
    return engineModel;
}

int main() {
    Car myCar("Toyota", 120, "V6-3.5L");
    myCar.displayInfo();
    cout << "Engine model: " << myCar.getEngineModel() << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```
### 2.
This is the foundation of object-oriented programming in C++. You can extend this by adding inheritance, polymorphism, and other advanced features.
